# Changelog for Thoth's Graph Refresh Job

## [0.4.0] - 2018-Jul-02 - goern

### Added

Starting with this release we have a Zuul-CI pipeline that:

* lints on Pull Requrest and gate/merge

## [0.3.0] - 2018-Jun-12 - goern

### Added

Set resource limits of BuildConfig and Deployment to reasonable values, this will prevent unpredicted behavior on UpShift.
